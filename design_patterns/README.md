Constructor Pattern 

As we know Javascript doesn’t support the concept of classes, but it support special constructor functions that works with the object by defining keyword “new”.
	
Module Pattern 

A module is an important piece of a robust application. To implement this pattern there are various ways defined

	Object Literal Pattern 
	Module Pattern 

Singleton Pattern 

Singleton pattern is based on the concept of single instance. I will explain with the example below
 
Observer pattern
Its a pattern where an object maintains a list of objects which is to be notified of changes
Components of this pattern are :
	Subject : Maintains a list of object
	Observer : provide an update for the internal object
