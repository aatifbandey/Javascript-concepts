Javascript is loosely typed language unlike C++ where you need to defined type of variable, but JS understand type
from the value 
Eg : var a = 1    // number 

	Destructor in Javascript

	There is no destructor in JS and it has a garbage collector that runs at regular interval and cleans up the free objects and freeing up memory


Calculate time execution of Functions in JS

	We can achieve this by console.time() or perform.now() api

Hoisting 

	Its one of the most important part of JS. The variable and function expression are hoisted on top;

	Eg console.log(x === undefined)   // True
		var x = 1;

		baz()   // it will work
		funtion baz(){

		}
 		baz()    // baz is not a function  since function expression is hoisted 
 		var baz = function(){

 		}

Constants
	
	These are immutable their value doesn't change
