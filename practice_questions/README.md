Two of the most common operations performed on data stored in a computer are sorting
and searching. This has been true since the beginning of the computer industry, so this
means that sorting and searching are two of the most studied operations in computer
science

BUBLE SORT 
It works like comparing element with next element a[i] > a[i+1] if yes then swap. Its the slowest sorting algo should be avoided
for large data

SELECTION SORT
This sort works by starting at the beginning of the array and comparing the first element with the remaining
elements
